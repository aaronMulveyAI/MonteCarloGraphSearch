## üìú Abstract

This thesis explores how to enhance the **Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)** algorithm by utilizing **transposition tables** and transforming its structure into a **directed acyclic graph (DAG)**, creating the **Monte Carlo Graph Search (MCGS)**. The results demonstrate that managing transpositions significantly improves efficiency in strategy games like Omega, highlighting the potential of these techniques for broader applications.

## üìä Key Results

- **Efficiency:**  
   UCD3 consistently outperformed other configurations, handling transpositions more efficiently.

- **Win Rate Comparison:**  
   UCD3 showed a significantly higher win rate compared to UCT0 and other basic MCTS variants.

- **Search Time:**  
   While UCT0 was faster for short searches, UCD3 optimized transposition handling for deeper searches.
